# Schrodinger Time Independent wave Equation

Schrodinger’s time-independent wave equation describes the standing waves. Sometimes the potential energy of the particle does not depend upon time, and the potential energy is only the function of position. In such cases, the behavior of the particle is expressed in terms of Schrodinger’s time-independent wave equation.
